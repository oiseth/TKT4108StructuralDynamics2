    "\n",
    "The simple frame's vertical members displayed below have negligible mass and transverse stiffness $k=10000$ N/m. The horizontal members can be modelled as rigid and with mass $m=1000$ kg. The frame is subjected to two random loads $X_1$ and $X_2$.\n",

    "**a)** The frame shall be modelled using two degrees of freedom, as indicated in the figure. Obtain the equation of motion for the frame. Use a Rayleigh damping matrix $\\mathbf{C}=0.03 \\mathbf{M}+0.001 \\mathbf{K}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Solve the eigenvalue problem to find the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes. Draw the modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Transform the system to modal (generalized) coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** The frame is subject to two stochastic loads. The standard deviation of the two loads is $1000$ N and their correlation coefficient is $\\rho=0.5$. Simulate time series for these two loads using a time step $\\Delta t=0.02$ s and simulation length $T=200$ s. Use Newmark integration to calculate the dynamic response of the frame. Perform the calculations in both modal and physical coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Why is the correlation of the dynamic actions $X_1$ and $X_2$ crucial for the response? Explain how the positive correlation ($\\rho>0$) or negative correlation ($\\rho<0$) of the two loads will influence the response of mode one and mode two. "
