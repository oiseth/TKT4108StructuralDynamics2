    "### Problem 1: Dynamic response of a shear frame\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple frame's vertical members displayed below have negligible mass and transverse stiffness $k$. The horizontal members can be modelled as rigid and with mass $m$. The frame is subjected to two random loads $X_1$ and $X_2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** The frame shall be modelled using two degrees of freedom, as indicated in the figure. Obtain the equation of motion for the frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Solve the eigenproblem to find the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes. Draw the modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Transform the system to normal (generalized) coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Use Newmark integration to calculate the dynamic response of the frame when it is subjected to a stochastic load. Perform the calculations in both normal and physical coordinates. Assume that the stiffness is $k=10000$, the story mass is $m=1000$, and the damping ratio for both vibration modes is $0.5\\%$. Further, assume that the standard deviation of the two loads is $1000$ N and that their correlation coefficient is $\\rho=0.5$. Use a time step $\\Delta t=0.02$ s and simulation length $T=200$ s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Take a look at xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Why is the correlation of the dynamic actions $X_1$ and $X_2$ crucial for the response? Explain how the positive correlation ($\\rho>0$) or negative correlation ($\\rho<0$) of the two loads will influence the response of mode one and mode two. \n",
    "\n",

Confirm that the area under the curve is unity by numerical integration and explain why this property is essential. Assume $\\sigma = 2$ when performing the numerical integration.\n",
