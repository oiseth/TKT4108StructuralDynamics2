    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will consider the glulam truss displayed below. The truss carries the roof of an industrial building, and there is production equipment used in the factory that is hanging down from the truss, introducing a stochastic dynamic excitation. In this problem, we will assess the vibrations and the load effects caused by the two stochastic loads.\n",

    "The truss spans 14 m, and the height of the truss is 1 m (measured from the centre bottom chord to the centre of the upper chord ). The members have cross-sectional dimensions of $b \\times h=200 \\times 200$ mm.  Set the elastic modulus $E=10\\cdot 10^3$ MPa. Assume a density of the material of $\\rho=2000$  kg/m$^3$. The density is higher than the glue-laminated timber since we have included mass from structural components that do not provide stiffness to the truss (the roof, secondary beams that support the roof, and other installations).\n",

Also, calculate the standard deviation and the correlation coefficient of the axial force in the two diagonals. Are the results as expected? Please explain.\n",

Perform the calculations in the frequency domain and compare your results to the ones obtained in the time domain. Try to make the calculations for several realizations of the loads and observe how the results change, and describe your observations. \n",
