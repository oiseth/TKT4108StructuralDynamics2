    "### Problem 1: Dynamic response for a single degree of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the rigid beam in the figure. The beam has a uniform mass per length $m$ and concentrated mass at the end $\\frac{1}{3}mL$. The beam can be modelled with one degree of freedom $u(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set $m=100$ kg/m, $L=10$ m, and $k=10^5$ N/m.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Set up the equation of motion by using moment equilibrium about point A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Find the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Find the value of $c$ such that the system has 2\\% damping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** The beam is subjected to a forced harmonic load $p(t)=p_0 \\cos(\\Omega t)$ at the tip, where $p_0=10^3$ N and $\\Omega=6$ rad/s. Find by hand calculation the steady state amplitude of $u(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Use Newmark numerical integration to calculate the dynamic response to the load defined in question d). Use a time step $\\Delta t=0.01$ s and simulation length $T=60$ s. Set the initial conditions to rest ($u=0$, $\\dot{u}=0$). Plot the response and compare the steady state amplitude to the one found in question d).\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Compare the response from in question e) to a quasi-static solution of the response. The quasi-static response can be obtained by removing all velocity and acceleration terms from the equation of motion, and solving for the displacement directly. Comment on the results (hint: dynamic magnification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** How much would the load frequency $\\Omega$ need to increase for the dynamic response magnification to become 10?"

    "### Problem 2: Dynamic response for multiple degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "The bridge in the figure has 4 rotational degrees of freedom. Set $m=1000$ kg/m, $L=10$ m, and $EI=10^8$ Nm$^2$.\n",

    "**a)** Set up the mass and stiffness matrices. Use the consistent element matrices of a standard beam element (see formula sheet) to assign the matrix items of $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes (not by hand!). Sketch the mode shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Assume the structure is Rayleigh damped, $\\mathbf{C}=\\alpha \\mathbf{M}+\\beta \\mathbf{K}$. Find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that modes 1 and 4 have 1.5% damping. What is the resulting damping in modes 2 and 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** A forced harmonic moment $p(t)=p_0 \\sin(\\Omega t)$ is applied in DOF $u_2$, where $p_0=10^5$ Nm and $\\Omega=20$ rad/s. Use Newmark numerical integration to calculate the dynamic response. Use a simulation length $T=30$ s, and determine a time step $\\Delta t$ small enough such that there are at least 20 data points per vibration cycle for mode 4. Set the initial conditions to rest ($\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}=\\mathbf{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** The structure has no degree of freedom in the middle of the bridge. Explain how you can still find the vertical displacement response at this location.\n"
