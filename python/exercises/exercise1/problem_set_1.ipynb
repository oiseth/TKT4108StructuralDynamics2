    "\n",
    "Consider the rigid beam in the figure. The beam has a uniform mass per length $m$ and concentrated mass at the end $\\frac{3mL}{10}$. The beam can be modelled with one degree of freedom $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set $m=100$ kg/m, $L=10$ m, $k=10^5$ N/m.\n",

    "a) Set up the equation of motion by using moment equilibrium about point A.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Find the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Find the value of $c$ such that the system has 2\\% damping.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The beam is subjected to a forced harmonic load $p(t)=p_0 \\cos(\\Omega t)$, where $p_0=10^3$ N and $\\Omega=5$ rad/s. Find by hand calculation the steady state amplitude of $u(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Use Newmark numerical integration to calculate the dynamic response to the load defined in question d). Use a time step $\\Delta t=0.01$ s and simulation length $T=60$ s. Set the initial conditions to rest ($u=0$, $\\dot{u}=0$). Plot the response and compare the steady state amplitude to the one found in question d).\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Compare the response from in question e) to a quasi-static solution of the response. The quasi-static response can be obtained by removing all velocity and acceleration terms from the equation of motion, and solving for the displacement directly. Comment on the results (hint: dynamic magnification).\n",
    "\n",
    "g) How much would the load frequency $\\Omega$ need to increase for a dynamic response magnification of 10?"

    "### Problem 2: Dynamic response for multiple degrees of freedom\n",

    "The bridge in the figure has 4 rotational degrees of freedom.\n",

    "b) Calculate the natural frequencies and mode shapes. Sketch the mode shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Assume the structure is Rayleigh damped, $\\mathbf{C}=\\alpha \\mathbf{M}+\\beta \\mathbf{K}$. Find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that modes 1 and 4 have 1.5% damping. What is the resulting damping in modes 2 and 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The bridge has a forced harmonic moment $p(t)=p_0 \\sin(\\Omega t)$ in DOF 2, where $p_0=10^3$ Nm and $\\Omega=xxx$ rad/s. Use Newmark numerical integration to calculate the dynamic response. Use a simulation length $T=100$ s, and determine a time step $\\Delta t$ such that there are at least 20 data points per vibration cycle for mode 4. Set the initial conditions to rest ($\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}=\\mathbf{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "e) The structure has no degree of freedom in the middle of the bridge. Explain how you still can find the vertical response at this location (hint: Hermittian shape functions of a beam element).\n"
